Package: alm
Title: R Client for the Lagotto Altmetrics API Platform.
Description: An R interface to the open source article level metrics API
    created by the Public Library of Science (PLOS). A number of publishers are
    using the open source app created by PLOS, so you can drop in a different
    base URL to the functions in this package to get to not only PLOS data, but
    data for Crossref, and more as the open source PLOS software is used.
    rCharts is in Enhances; and can be used for creating interactive charts
    (e.g., in the function plot_signposts in this package); obtain rCharts at
    https://github.com/ramnathv/rCharts.
